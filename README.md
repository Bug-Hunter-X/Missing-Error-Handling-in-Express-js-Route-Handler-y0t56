# Missing Error Handling in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: the lack of proper error handling when dealing with user input. Specifically, the example shows a route that accesses user data based on an ID passed in the request parameters without validating the ID or handling cases where the ID is invalid or the user doesn't exist. 

The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version that includes error handling using try-catch blocks and appropriate status codes.
